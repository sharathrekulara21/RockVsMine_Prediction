# Rock vs Mine Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether an object in the dataset is a rock or a mine based on various features.
## About

The project uses machine learning models to classify objects as rocks or mines based on their features. It demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (mine) and a roughly cylindrical rock.
